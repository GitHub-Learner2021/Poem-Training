##May add other seasons as they come


Winter has gone
The cold has defrost
Though it does not snow in Wellington
The cold was enough to freeze a person


Spring is here
And the fresh breeze is near
Bugs and critters arise
And an open window and light invites them to arrive



branch ##trying the addition of Summer

Summer has yet to come
But if the past years were to be believed
Autumn colours like yellow leaves 
Will soon be seen
